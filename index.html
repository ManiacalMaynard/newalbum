        <h3>Initial User Survey</h3>
          Started with a short survey that included seven participants: Five music fans, and two music promoters. Due to the limited project scope for the project, I decided it was best to focus specifically on the prompt (“New Album Landing Page”) rather than a full-fledged band web site. This allowed me to focus on the primary audience and intention before moving onto secondary user types or flows. The survey went very smoothly, responses helped illuminate that “listen”, “purchase”, and “tour dates” were the primary motivations for users. The results also informed certain aspects of how users relate to a band both visually and aurally. How users'preferences and tastes align with the band sound, aesthetic, and overall style has a huge impact on user behavior. Link to survey.</div>

          <h3>Results Map</h3> 
          By arranging the survey results by theme, I was able to more easily visualize how to prioritize the results which informed our personas, problem statements, and goal priorities. Survey responses were clear in the users' priorities: Listen, purchase, and tour dates, respectively. Users clearly wanted to listen to a sample before making a purchase or ticket decision. It was also of note that users wanted all three of these information groups to be available on the album landing page without having to click off to another site for more information. Responses were color coded by respondent and organized thematically via Jamboard. Link to Jamboard image.</div>
          
        <div class="content"><h3>User Personas</h3> From the survey findings I developed two user personas to help focus design goals. I divide users into two groups: fans and promoters. Fans are represented by Hercule Charly who loves to listen to new, exciting music and may purchase digital or physical versions of albums to add to his collection. Promoters are represented by Joyce Parker who wants to hear smaller samples of more songs from a band and get a bit of background information before determining viability for a live show booking. Both users prioritize “listen” over “purchase” but also want to easily find other relevant information quickly. Link to Users Personas file.</div>

    <h2>Define</h2>
    <div>
    <p><h3>User Need Statement(s)</h3>
    <p>Hercule is a/an older music collector who needs easy to navigate and accessible album information because confusing web sites are frustrating.</p>
    <p>Joyce is a busy music professional who needs up to date and accurate information about an album and the band because she has no time to hunt down that information.</p>

    <p><h3>Competitive Analysis</h3> Once there was a more clear picture of what our users are after, I performed an audit of 12 new releases and chose 5 landing pages from that group for deeper analysis. These were specifically chosen from a variety of music genres and band popularity to help me understand a wide-spectrum of approaches. Overall the pages informed about the new album they were promoting and offered some level of listening engagement and information. It was interesting that there were a variety of approaches to listening and many pages choose to send users away to an outside service (e.g. Spotify, Apple Music, etc) rather than directly on the landing page. Other issues were in forcing users away from the page to purchase and the lack of tour dates and bio information. By unifying all of this information on a single page load, I feel that users will be more likely to listen and, ideally, to buy. Link to analysis grid and notes.</p>
