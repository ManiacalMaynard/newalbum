# Case Study: New Music Album Landing Page

**Google UX Certification, Responsive Web Site Project, Section 6, Overview and Process Notes**

The goal here is to present a web-based version of a fairly standard UX Design Case Study. These projects are often created as presentation documents but I wanted to practice my front end coding skills as well as make the study more easily available as a portfolio piece in it's own right.

The web site will present an introduction and overall project specifications. Subsequent sections will highlight each step of the UX process for a new music album landing page built with responsive layout and accessibility in focus. Each section will include a short description of the work completed at that stage and why as well as links to relevant images, documents, etc. Finally, a summation will describe what I learned through the process, future goals for refinement of the project, and more.

Wish me luck!
